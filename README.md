# Overview

This project explores theimplementation of key distributedsystemdesign(DSD) concepts, including replication, faulttolerance, containerization, and loadbalancing. Utilizing technologies like Couchbase for database management, Docker forcontainerization, Nginx forwebserving, reverseproxying, loadbalancing, and AWS services such as Elastic Load Balancing(ELB) and Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2),we aim to effectively implement these DSD features for handling large-scale data.
