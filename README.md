# Overview

This project explores the implementation of key distributed system design(DSD) concepts, including replication, faulttolerance, containerization, and loadbalancing. Utilizing technologies like Couchbase for database management, Docker forcontainerization, Nginx for webserving, reverse proxying, load balancing, and AWS services such as Elastic Load Balancing(ELB) and Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2),we aim to effectively implement these DSD features for handling large-scale data.
